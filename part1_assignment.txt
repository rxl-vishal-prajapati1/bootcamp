1) How java follows "Write Once And Run Anywhere" concept?
    
    Java programs are compiled to byte code which are platform independent. Byte code are converted to machine code by JVM.

2) Do java support pass by value and pass by reference?
    
    Java supports pass by value.

3) Write a program to add 3 to the ASCII value of the character 'd'
and print the equivalent character.
    
    char c = 'd';
    c += 3;
    System.out.println(c);

    // output: g

4) What is the size in bits for a 'byte' data type.

    byte is of 8 bits.
5) Which of the following lines will compile without warning or error?
    a) char d="d";
    b) float f=3.1415;
    c) int i=34;
    d) byte b=257;
    e) boolean isPresent=true;
      
      Following won't compile:
        a) char d = "d"; "d" is a String not char
        b) float f = 3.1415; 3.1415 is a double. We've to append 'f' at the end.
        d) byte b = 257; Range of byte is -128 to 127

6)Which of the following expressions will evaluate to 7?
    a) 2 + 4 * 3- 7
    b) (2 + 4) * (3 - 7)
    c) 2 + (4 * 3) - 7
    d) ((2 + 4) * 3) - 7)
      
      Following will evaluates to 7:
        a) 2 + 4 * 3 - 7
        c) 2 + (4 * 3) - 7

7) Which of the following statement will compile?
  int i = 5; int j = 10;
  a) while(i < j) {}
  b) while(i) {}
  c) while(i = 5) {}
  d) while((i = 12)!=5) {}
      
      Following will compile: (Why? TODO)
        a) while (i < j) {  }
        b) while ((i = 12) != 5) {  }

8) What is the result of the following operation?
    System.out.println(4 % 3);

    // Output: 1  

9)Which of the following if statements will compile without errors?
  int i = 3; int j = 3; int k = 3;
  1. if(i > j) {}
  2. if(i > j > k) {}
  3. if(i > j && i > k) {}
  4. if(i > j && > k) {}

      Following will compile:
        1. if (i > j) {  }
        3. if (i > j && i > k) {  }
      operator > is a binary operator and it requires 2 operands
        in 2. if (i > j > k) {  } -- i > j is not a valid operand
        in 4. if (i > j && > k) {}  -- lhs operand is not there for " > k"

10. What will be printed out when the following code is executed?
  switch (5) {
    case 0:
      System.out.println("zero");
      break;
    case 1:
      System.out.println("one");
    default:
      System.out.println("default");
    case 2:
      System.out.println("two");
   }

    
    Output:
    default
    two
    
    code in default block will get executed as there is no break statement all statements 
    below it until break is executed.

11) What's the output of the following code?
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      boolean myVal = false;
      if (myVal = true)
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
          System.out.println(i);
      else
        System.out.println("else");
    }
  }

  Output:
    0
    1

  "myVal = true" is true as the value is first assigned then use so if block is executed.

12) What's the output of the following code?
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int i = 10;
        do
          while (i < 15)
            i = i + 20;
        while (i < 2);
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }


  Output: 
    30
  
  while (i < 15) is true in first iteration, it'll update value of i to 30.
